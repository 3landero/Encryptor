# Encryptor

It was a very simple exercise, really, but it was a project with many lessons

i had the chance to learn about Regex fundamentals, and many ways to handle a string.

Of course, the main achievement in this app for me was to perform a real work of programming all by myself.
I didn't follow any video tutorial, the researchs i made this time were about the language sintaxis

It was one the most revealing projects for me, i felt like a real programmer
